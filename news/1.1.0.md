# csol 1.1.0 released

New features:

- Win condition added in the form of the property win_rank on game rules. It is set to king by default on all foundations which means that the game has been won when each foundation has a king as its top card.

Fixed issues:

- [#1](https://github.com/nielssp/csol/issues/1): Removes the redeal limit from klondike, since most common implementations don't include it.
